**Usage**
  * Heap Sort
  * Priority Queue
  * Graph Algorithms

**Scenarios**

* Get the median of an ordered stream
  * Key Point
    * Keep a max heap and min heap 
    * May use the go built-in heap package
      * The `up` and `down` operation is a typical `swim` and `sink` operation of a heap
  * Principle
    * Using the heap sort. (if the stream is ordered, no need to order again)
  * Examples
    * LC295. https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/description/
