# Summary

### Three Types of Permutation, Combination and Set Problems

Generally, there are 3 types of classic problems for `Permutation`, `Combination` and `Set` problems. There maybe some other variants from these 3 types.

    1. Choose from a list which contains `Non-Duplicate` elements, and element can ONLY be used for ONE time.
    2. Choose from a list which contains `Duplicate` elements, and element can ONLY be used for ONE times.
    3. Choose from a list which contains `Non-Duplicate` elements, and element can be used for MULTIPLE times.
