## Principles

**Merge Sort**
* Complexity
  * T: O(N*logN)
  * S: O(N)
* Key Points
  * Can not swap on the original array. 

**Heap Sort**
  * Complexity
    * T: O(N*logN)
    * S: 
      * O(logN) Recursive
      * O(1) iterative
  * Key Points
    * In-place sorting
    * not stable. May make stable
  * About Heap
    * A complete Binary Tree
    * swim and sink are equal

**Problems**

* LC912 sort an array
  * Merge Sort. Space O(N)

* LC327 Count of Range Sum
  * Merge Sort usage.
    * handle logic and then sort
  * Similar as LC315, LC493
