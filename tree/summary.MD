**Principles**

1. The `diameter` is the largest value of `sum(max_depth_of_left_subtree, max_depth_of_right_subtree)` of all of nodes of the tree

**Traverse**
1. BF
    * Usually based on `Queue`
    * Can also use recursive
2. DF
    * PreOrder
    * InOrder
    * PostOrder


**Thinking Patterns**
1. Tree Traverse
2. Recursive with sub trees
